When new Reserves are sold on the market, the assets used by market participants to purchase the new Reserves are held as collateral. This process keeps the Reserve collateralized at a 1:1 ratio even as supply increases.At times, the Reserve Protocol may target a collateralization ratio greater than 1:1. When this is the case, scaling the supply of Reserve tokens requires additional capital in order to maintain the target collateralization ratio. To accomplish this the Reserve Protocol mints and sells Reserve Rights tokens in exchange for additional collateral tokens.Collateral tokens are somewhat volatile. While we may be able to select a portfolio with minimal downside risk, the reality is that drops in the collateral tokens&amp;#39; value will happen. When this happens, the Reserve Protocol will sell newly minted Reserve Rights tokens for additional collateral tokens and add them to the backing.","Serum is\u00a0a completely decentralized derivatives exchange with trustless cross-chain trading brought to you by Project Serum, in collaboration with a consortium of crypto trading and DeFi experts.

(BTS)."],"label":[2,2,13,35,3,3,36,17,1,35,1,1,36,33,2,1,34,4,32,27,13,23,2,4,1,32,32,32,2,32,27,1,27,37,2,17,24,15,20,18,24,16,21,20,9,27,35,8,14,13,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,42,42,10,3,3,34,27,4,29,-1,34,2,8,23,23,2,-1,41,23,10,15,-1,2,2,41,35,30,22,38,21,31,-1,25,13,25,38,29,3,-1,34,-1,39,15,20,23,30,5,10,2,-1,17,24,-1,38,15,23,24,25,25,35,34,2,38,17,2,33,-1,12,29,34,-1,13,15,16,13,27,31,30,34,2,-1,4,25,2,14,16,34,22,14,29,42,25,23,-1,13,24,31,32,28,4,1,20,18,5,13,17,27,29,-1,9,35,30,19,-1,13,13,11,21,-1,42,7,33,17,6,12,-1,34,20,40,16,25,16,4,35,26,26,38,16,2,2,33,16,24,37,29,6,6,19,19,28,36,10,10,11,35,38,-1,36,13,26,10,13,29,38,8,-1,11,2,4,16,15,16,-1,2,-1,15,24,15,15,39,24,40,10,10,32,2,8,27,34,7,38,39,34,-1,37,34,25,-1,-1,29,38,33,29,5,10,29,21,28,16,16,41,12,24,4,32,10,7,15,18,-1,42,12,24,32,22,2,24,7,-1,9,25,20,2,40,40,10,37,4,12,34,4,4,2,2,38,38,-1,13,41,16,-1],"level_0":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309],"x":{"__ndarray__":"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","dtype":"float32","order":"little","shape":[310]},"y":{"__ndarray__":"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
