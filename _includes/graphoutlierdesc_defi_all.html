While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&amp;#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&amp;#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&amp;#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&amp;#39;s market cap.This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and \u201ccommunity\u201d needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&amp;#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows.\u00a0In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.","Argentum is another fast block time coin at 32 seconds.

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 \u201cThe Economics of Digital Currencies\u201d, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most\u00a0successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin.\u00a0\u00a0","Nibble another litecoin clone.

The multiplier is directly used in the reward calculation by multiplying it with the base Synergy interest rate of 10% per year.Holders build the Turbo Stake multiplier over two days by staking consistently. After that, the multiplier will level out and the holder will stake with a consistent rate that depends on how much stake competes with his.

Xaurum is meant to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency,\u00a0Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR.\u00a0In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be\u00a0in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them.\u00a0When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins\u00a0from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies are used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold.\u00a0The\u00a0proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself.\u00a0When minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not maintain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.","BitFinex Tokens were issued by BitFinex as obligations by the exchange for the 36% haircut on customer account after the hack in August 2016.

Radicle Link extends Git with peer-to-peer discovery by disseminating data via a process called gossip. That is, participants in the network share and spread data they are \"interested\" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing, otherwise known as \"replicating\", their local data with selected peers. By leveraging Git&amp;#39;s smart transfer protocol, Radicle Link keeps Git&amp;#39;s efficiency when it comes to data replication while offering global decentralized repository storage through the peer-to-peer networking layer.Since all data on the network is stored locally by peers on the network, developers can share and collaborate on Git repositories without relying on intermediaries such as hosted servers.\u00a0The easiest way to use Radicle is with Upstream, a desktop client developed by the founding team of the Radicle project.

At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an \"airdrop\", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution. \u00a0Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.","Aurora Chain is\u00a0a smart contract platform for decentralized applications.

The project was born out of a dream to build an entirely democratized internet free from the centralized hands of corporate greed, where all data and information is completely held in the public domain, giving governance of this data back to the masses via consensus and democracy.The Problem:Free-speech and anti-censorship are the cornerstone of any democracy but with the rise of deplatforming and online censorship, media platforms our society relies on are becoming more and more unreliable for the average user. Free-flowing information and ideas are almost always catalysts for the next stages of societal evolution and exponential technological growth. Online censorship today ranges from something as small as a single blocked tweet all the way up to a full corporate website being banned if the messaging doesn\u2019t fit an individual platforms definition of appropriate.The Solution:Giving the power back to society via consensus to determine a broader definition of appropriate information and messaging is the project goal.\u00a0It has\u00a0accomplished this in three ways:-Decentralize content &amp;amp; storage hosting, so no single entity has control over what is appropriate.-Utilize community and user consensus to moderate this decentrally stored content.-Maintain a closed-loop economy around steps one and two to encourage participation, reward contribution and network utilization.Decentralized Content &amp;amp; Storage Network:At the core, the Ether-1 Network is built on top of an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain, utilizing a hybrid POW (proof-of-work) consensus mechanism and a network of community-owned collateralized nodes which all contribute storage and bandwidth to the network.Decentralized Governance for Content Moderation:Pure free-speech and anti-censorship comes at the cost of any piece of data being allowed on the network unchecked. It balances this with allowing collateralized node/network participants to moderate content based on on-chain decentralized voting. Governance participants are rewarded for their participation in the system.Economy Built to Reward Participation and Utilization:All network participants are rewarded monetarily in our native coin (ETHO) for their contributions. Collateralized node owners and miners are all rewarded each block with a share of the block reward. Node owners also receive a split of network storage revenue generated from data uploads.Click here for Masternode stats from masternodes.online.","LON is a utility token issued by the Tokenlon DEX, used to align all ecosystem stakeholders and incentivize participation and expansion of the ecosystem.\u00a0Currently, it\u2019s hard to find the best price as liquidity is fragmented over the whole DEX market.

To facilitate this, the RFI smart contract exposes some new methods that allow staking contracts to easily determine the fees earned by each holder for any period of time even when funds are pooled together.\u00a0This is a huge leap that enables direct staking of RFI and double yield generation.","BosonCoin is a Proof of Work/Proof of Stake cryptocurrency using the X11 hashing algorithm.

Thanks to it, BTCV users have a 24-hour window to cancel unauthorized transactions.The idea is to give users the possibility to react and eliminate potential theft by reversing the transaction in case one private key is lost or stolen. By delaying the default time necessary to transfer assets from one block (around 10 minutes) to 144 blocks (24 hours), and providing another key to cancel the transfer, users can rest assured that their funds are secure.The ecosystem of Bitcoin Vault will allow you to create different types of wallets:\u00b7 Standard,\u00b7 2-Key Vault,\u00b7 and 3-Key Vault wallet.Each one of them can be used to send and receive crypto assets, but the transactions are different. Apart from Standard transactions, which lack additional security features, users can also make quick Secure Fast transactions and reversible Secure transactions. The reversible transactions are a novelty in the crypto world. They can be canceled within approximately 24 hours, which is the time it takes to mine 144 blocks to confirm the transaction on the blockchain. Now, when a suspicious or erroneous transaction occurs, users have a chance to stop it before their funds are gone!Bitcoin Vault Security Keys\u2022 Standard Transaction KeyThe Standard Transaction key is generated along with each wallet. It mainly runs in the background to ensure the smooth operation of all transactions. Apart from functioning like an invisible layer of extra safety, it can also be used to recover the wallet in case of a security breach or technical issue.\u2022 Cancel Transaction KeyAs the name suggests, this key allows users to cancel transactions. This has been made possible by regulating the number of blocks it takes to confirm the transaction on the blockchain to 144. It allows wallet owners to reverse a transaction within approximately 24 hours of a regular BTCV transfer.\u2022 Fast Transaction KeyThis key is necessary to perform Fast transactions. It can be used to execute a transfer in about 10 minutes, after one block is generated, allowing BTCV users to make quick transactions with trusted parties.How Many Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) Coins Are There In Circulation?The total supply of Bitcoin Vault is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as \u201cmining\u201d: as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.As compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain.Facebook | Instagram | Youtube","There is no longer a functional website for this crypto currency - although the coin has 33 million total units to be mined by proof of work and X11.The official ConSpiracy Coin ticker is \u201cCYC\u201d and trades under that name on all the exchanges where it has been listed.
