The goal of this project was to cluster the given company descriptions and the industry labels classify them by matching them with the target technologies and The Global Industry Classification Standard.

For these tasks I used [Sentence-BERT]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf

Sentence-BERT finetunes a pre-trained BERT network using Siamese and triplet network structures and adds a pooling operation to the output of BERT to derive a fixed-sized sentence embedding vector. The produced embedding vector is more appropriate for sentence similarity comparisons within a vector space

I got the BERT encodings for each sentence in the corpus and then did a semantic search using the cosine similarity to match to a query (either a word or another short sentence).

Below you can see the embeddings of the given data.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
