The aim of this project was clustering given coin descriptions 

To create cluster summaries, class-based variant of TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) [BERTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic) methodology is used. Treated all documents in a single category (a cluster) as a single document and then applied TF-IDF.
Took the top 10 most important words in each cluster. 

Below you can see the visualizations and tables.
